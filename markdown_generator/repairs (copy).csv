Air Fryer,air_fryer,1,13/08/23,Unbranded Air Fryer,N/A,Dead thermal fuse,Replace thermal fuse,£60.00,20p,TODO,Yes,Sparks Repair Cafe,./air_fryer/air_fryer_1.jpg,Air fryer came in not working at all, 99 times out of 100 with things like this it’s going to be the thermal fuse. The issue is taking the sodding thing apart! Very much not designed to be serviced / fixed, considering the fix is a 20p thermal fuse that needs to be replaced…
Portable Projector – Dead Battery,portable_projector,2,21/01/24,Projector,Harmon Kardon,Dead battery,N/A,,N/A,TODO,No,Sparks Repair Cafe,./projector/projector_2.jpg ./projector/projector_1.jpg,This projector came in that wouldn’t boot at all. It’s a portable mini projector, but no buttons would do anything and wouldn’t work. Started to disassemble, and checked the battery which was totally dead! You can’t get replacements for this battery because it’s got to be a specific size in order to fit inside the container. Unfortunate very expensive and sophisticated bit of kit all to end up as junk because you can’t get a replacement battery, and you can’t run it by having it plugged in!
Broken Blinds,blinds,3,TODO,Slat blinds,Ikea,Trapped mechanism,Re-attach string and fasten,£80.00,0p,TODO,Yes,Sparks Repair Cafe,./blinds/blinds_1.jpg ./blinds/blinds_2.jpg ./blinds/blinds_3.jpg,Blinds came in that weren’t able to retract properly, the issue was that the string had come loose in the mechanism, and needed to be re-fed through the spindle and fixed in place.
Camera Lens Stuck,camera_lens,4,TODO,Camera,Canon,Lens stuck opening,Bit of oil on mechanism,~£50,0p,TODO,Yes,Sparks Repair Cafe,./camera/camera_1.jpg,Camera came in that had issue automatically opening the lens covers when booting. Disassemble and very precisely add a tiny dab of oil on the mechanism that releases/retracts the covers. Cycle the camera a few times and now the mechanism opens happily. Pretty sure a collection of dust and nasty stuff gunked up the mechanism
Portable Coffee Grinder,portable_grinder,5,TODO,Grinder,UFIT,Motor wouldn’t move grinder,Insert missing circlip,£25.00,1p,TODO,Yes,Sparks Repair Cafe,./coffee_grinder/coffee_grinder_1.jpg,Grinder was donated in the junk box, that would hold a charge and you could hear the motor spin, but the actual grinder mechanism wouldn’t engage. Open the device up and one of the circlips that holds the attachment in place had snapped or come loose, and now the thing was fixed for the cost of a 1p circlip! One of our volunteers is using it to grind up egg shells to make egg shell porcelain with!
Infernal Coffee machine,coffee_machine,6,TODO,Bean to cup machine,Jura,MYSTERY,ALSO MYSTERY,£8,000.00,0p,TODO,Yes? No? ,Sparks Repair Cafe,./coffee_machine/coffee_machine_1.jpg ./coffee_machine/coffee_machine_2.jpg,Coffee machine that came in from one of the stalls in sparks that would have an error during the boot up sequence. It would give some error code on the screen that didn’t describe much and Google searching came up with no information! I could hear a relay engaging before it switched off, so there must be some software deciding to turn itself off, so I figured that the code was successfully executing but some status during the bootup sequence was bad and engaged some safety process. I spent the end of many sessions trying to get into this thing, and then diagnosing it. Both of the control boards were fine, no visible issues that screamed error. Started unplugging cables that went to the control board to see which one triggered the fail state, and eventually found a 2-cable connector that would cause it to fail the boot process. When I unplugged it, it was able to get past that auto shut off, but then returned an error later in the boot process saying that something was disconnected. Followed that cable and it lead to a pressure sensor of sorts that wasn’t well connected, so I think it just wasn’t making electrical contact! Re-connected it and reassembled the machine, and then got to enjoy a cup of coffee from the machine. Very satisfying cup of coffee!
Shredded gears with your e-bike sir?,e_bike,7,TODO,E-bike,Unbranded,Shredded planetary gears,Replace gearbox and bearings ,,£25.00,TODO,Yes,Sparks Repair Cafe,./e-bike/e-bike_1.jpg ./e-bike/e-bike_14.jpg ./e-bike/e-bike_8.jpg ./e-bike/e-bike_15.jpg ./e-bike/e-bike_9.jpg ./e-bike/e-bike_5.jpg ./e-bike/e-bike_6.jpg ./e-bike/e-bike_16.jpg ./e-bike/e-bike_4.jpg ./e-bike/e-bike_17.jpg ./e-bike/e-bike_12.jpg ./e-bike/e-bike_3.jpg ./e-bike/e-bike_10.jpg ./e-bike/e-bike_7.jpg ./e-bike/e-bike_2.jpg ./e-bike/e-bike_11.jpg ./e-bike/e-bike_13.jpg,We had this e-bike that was donated to the repair cafe, that no longer worked and the person involved didn’t want it back as they had an upgrade and had been told it was unfixable. Bit of diagnosing later, as I could get the motor to spin with the throttle, but the wheel itself would stop and start and stutter, which didn’t make much sense. I knew that the battery was fine as I could test the voltage on that, and as it’s a brushless motor and controller, it didn’t make much sense why the wheel would stop/start/stop, so seemed more of a mechanical issue. So I removed the whole motor connectors and opened the housing for the in-wheel motor. Inside the housing was a disgusting mix of black grease, along with the remains of the nylon planetary gears that had been absolutely shredded to the extent that they were basically smooth around 2/3 of the gear face! This made sense why the wheel would spin for a little bit and then stop! When I was re-assembling the motor housing I found out why the gears had shredded themselves to bits however! The bearings for the motor were totally seized and would not budge in the slightest!! So the motor and gearbox would have been straining against seized bearings which would allow a bit of movement and then stop, which is most likely why the gears got shredded. Bought a bunch of new bearings and pressed those in happily. Then I had to source a replacement planetary gear set and re-grease it and assemble which all was possible and found the exact match of nylon pair and flooded the gearbox with a bunch of high temp grease and it works like a dream. I still get messages from the person who eventually got it who is very happy with it and has no issues
Mangled Cable – Scooter,e_scooter,8,TODO,E-Scooter,Halfords,Exploded PCB from cable being crushed,N/A,,,TODO,No,Sparks Repair Cafe,./e_scooter/e_scooter_9.jpg ./e_scooter/e_scooter_4.jpg ./e_scooter/e_scooter_6.jpg ./e_scooter/e_scooter_3.jpg ./e_scooter/e_scooter_1.jpg ./e_scooter/e_scooter_2.jpg ./e_scooter/e_scooter_5.jpg ./e_scooter/e_scooter_8.jpg ./e_scooter/e_scooter_7.jpg,Scooter came in, it wouldn’t turn on at all and the electric motor wouldn’t spin. Taking it apart, when looking at the PCB there was a very obvious track that had gotten so hot it de-laminated itself and burnt the copper track such that it was an open circuit! When taking it further apart, what had happened was the control and power cables that go up to the control module, had been crushed in a pinch point in the scooter stem, causing a GPIO line to the microcontroller to get a whopping 24V! This was the GPIO line that measures the throttle, so once I’d sorted and fixed the cable, even though it would turn on, and the micro would do something (send signals to the gate drivers), the GPIO pin on the micro was toast, and the entire thing would have to be replaced. As the code to flash the micro is unavailable, it is essentially un-fixable. I looked online for suitable brushless motor controllers at 24V, but couldn’t find one that would fit the requirements for the scooter. Unfortunately, the whole electric portion of this scooter is now broken. It still functions as a scooter though!
Headphones cable issue,headphones,9,TODO,Headphones,N/A,Intermittent connection,New audio cable,£80.00,0p,TODO,Yes,Sparks Repair Cafe,./headphones_wire/headphones_wire_1.jpg ./headphones_wire/headphones_wire_3.jpg ./headphones_wire/headphones_wire_2.jpg,Headphones came in that had an intermittent connection and would crackle on one of the speakers. Electrical test between them showed a bad connection in the 3.5mm jack end, and they’d already brought in a 3.5mm jack to replace it with. The quality of the existing cables wasn’t great so I thought it better and easier to swap it out for a moulded 3.5mm jack. Went through the junk collection we have and found a perfectly suitable one to replace it with, that saved the wire getting junked for scrap.
Bad IMU Production,IMU,10,TODO,IMU,DFRobot,Shorted connection on IMU,Remove excess solder,,,TODO,Yes,Home,./IMU/IMU_6.jpg ./IMU/IMU_5.jpg ./IMU/IMU_1.jpg ./IMU/IMU_7.jpg ./IMU/IMU_4.jpg ./IMU/IMU_2.jpg ./IMU/IMU_3.jpg ,This is an issue I had during PhD, where we’d purchased a few IMUs at once and one of them just wouldn’t boot and wouldn’t turn on. I couldn’t resist opening it up and having a look at what the issue was. Turns out the IMU chip itself had an issue during soldering, causing 3.3V to be shorted to ground, as you can see in the photos. This was quite surprising, as if 3.3V was shorted, it wouldn’t have been possible to flash the devices in the factory with the microcontroller code? The corresponding microcontroller is powered by 3.3V, so it needed that rail to be correct. The manufacturers obviously didn’t have a check to see if the micros were successfully flashed! We got a full refund once we showed these images
Kobo Reader Leak,kobo_reader,11,TODO,E-Reader,Kobo,Water damage,Scrap,???,N/A,TODO,No,Sparks Repair Cafe,./kobo_reader/kobo_reader_2.jpg ./kobo_reader/kobo_reader_3.jpg ./kobo_reader/kobo_reader_1.jpg,E-reader had a bit of moisture ingress from something being spilled on it. Opened it up and there was a bunch of backlight LEDs that had shorted and exploded, which meant that the LED power rail had been ruined. Removed the offending LEDs and followed the rail back to the source, but still wouldn’t generate the voltage required. Followed the connection from the LED to a chip that controls the screen matrix, and there’s some issue there, but there is no documentation available for that chip, so it’s basically a dead end at that point. The parts did not go to waste however! The battery has gone towards a project I’m working on that needed a nice flat battery!
Dodgy Strimmer Connection,strimmer,12,TODO,Strimmer,N/A,Snapped connection on motor,Re-solder power cable,???,0p,TODO,Yes,Sparks Repair Cafe,./lawn_mower/lawn_mower_2.jpg ./lawn_mower/lawn_mower_3.jpg ./lawn_mower/lawn_mower_1.jpg,Electric strimmer wouldn’t turn on and move, but all the connections from the plug to the cables seemed fine. Turns out inside the little choke before the motor connection, under the heatshrink, the spool of wire had been twisted too much and needed re-soldering. Nice and simple fix once the issue had been found!
MacBook water ingress,macbook,13,TODO,MacBook air,Apple,Water damage,Replace FPC connector,,N/A,TODO,No,Home,./macbook/macbook_3.jpg ./macbook/macbook_2.jpg ./macbook/macbook_4.jpg ./macbook/macbook_6.jpg ./macbook/macbook_5.jpg ./macbook/macbook_7.jpg ./macbook/macbook_1.jpg ,Water got spilled on a friend’s laptop, and would turn on but the screen didn’t show anything. Taking it apart showed the connection from the mobo to the screen had a short and melted and damaged the screen connector. The whole connector would have to be replaced, which I’m going to do once I source the right component and reset the laptop.
Bang-polar Junction Transistor,magnifier,14,TODO,Magnifier light,N/A,Exploded BJT converted to dust,Replace BJT and board,£20.00,10p,TODO,Yes,Sparks Repair Cafe,./magnifier_light/magnifier_light_1.jpg,A magnification and combined lamp wouldn’t turn on the lights found in the recycling bin. Taking it apart there’s a simple potentiometer that controls the current to the LEDs via a BJT that had exploded and taken the PCB with it. Jury-rigged a simple circuit on perfboard that connects to the potentiometer that achieves the same thing. It is now my desk magnification for when I need something extra!
Marantz Amplifier,marantz_amplifier,15,TODO,,Marantz,,,,,TODO,,,./marantz_amplifier/marantz_amplifier_2.jpg ./marantz_amplifier/marantz_amplifier_1.jpg,TODO
Marshall Bluetooth Headphones,marshall_headphones,16,TODO,Headphones,Marshall,No Bluetooth,Replace battery and NTC,???,£12.00,TODO,Yes,Sparks Repair Cafe,./marshall_headphones/marshall_headphones_1.jpg,Pair of Marshall wireless headphones that would work if you plugged an audio source into the 3.5mm audio jack, but wouldn’t boot and accept a bluetooth connection. Opened them up, and the battery was entirely dead! Sourced a replacement that would fit inside the headphones, but they didn’t come with an NTC resistor like the original battery. Bought a replacement NTC and put that in a suitable position and it all works fine! The standard NTC for this battery was a 10kR, but it’s worth checking with the original as if you choose the wrong ranged resistor, the onboard micro might consider it as a fault!
Microphone Screen dodgy,microphone,17,TODO,Microphone,???,Lines on screen,Clean connector,???,0p,TODO,Yes,Sparks Repair Cafe,./microphone/microphone_1.jpg ./microphone/microphone_2.jpg ./microphone/microphone_3.jpg,Device works fine in terms of recording audio and turning on, but there are a series of lines on the screen that don’t disappear and never turn on. Open it up, and the ribbon cable connection from the screen to the mainboard was old and slightly corroded and making a bad connection. Used a bit of switch cleaner and a Q-Tip to clean up the connector and the issue disappeared!
Microwave,microwave,18,TODO,Microwave,,Won’t produce heat,Scrap,???,N/A,TODO,No,Sparks Repair Cafe,./microwave/microwave_2.jpg ./microwave/microwave_1.jpg,Don’t usually look at microwaves, but thought it might be an easy fix of a dodgy connector, as the screen would turn on and you could change dials and settings, but didn’t actually ‘go’ and start powering the microwave. I thought it would be an issue from the push buttons not making a good connection, but they all worked properly. Unfortuantely probably something with the electronic portal to hell that heats the food. Into the scrap it went, but we kept the control board to salvage components as and when we need them
PA Kit,pa_kit,19,TODO,Speakers,,Went bang!,Replace drivers and board components,£600.00,£118.28,TODO,Yes,Sparks Repair Cafe,./PA_speakers/PA_speakers_12.jpg ./PA_speakers/PA_speakers_7.jpg ./PA_speakers/PA_speakers_6.jpg ./PA_speakers/PA_speakers_10.jpg ./PA_speakers/PA_speakers_13.jpg ./PA_speakers/PA_speakers_9.jpg ./PA_speakers/PA_speakers_17.jpeg ./PA_speakers/PA_speakers_11.jpg ./PA_speakers/PA_speakers_4.jpg ./PA_speakers/PA_speakers_2.jpg ./PA_speakers/PA_speakers_8.jpg ./PA_speakers/PA_speakers_3.jpg ./PA_speakers/PA_speakers_16.jpeg ./PA_speakers/PA_speakers_1.jpg ./PA_speakers/PA_speakers_15.jpeg ./PA_speakers/PA_speakers_14.jpg ./PA_speakers/PA_speakers_5.jpg,Guys came in with a PA set that had been plugged in when the bassist incorrectly wired up one of their pedals/amplifiers, then there was an awful sound and a disgusting smell, according to them. Had a cursory look at the PA deck, to make sure nothing was wrong there and didn’t see anything immediately broken. Open the speaker cabs and look at the pre-filters and the 20W resistor as part of the RLC filter had gotten so hot the legs had exploded out of both speakers! The thermal fuse on both boards inside the speakers had exploded and released their magic smoke. One of the cones sounded pretty damaged, my rubric for that being if you push in on one of the cones and hear a ‘crinkly’ sound, like a crisp packet being rustled, the driver is damaged. One speaker cone sounded exactly like that, and the other one sounded similar bit not as bad. I asked the people who brought them in, and they were happy to replace both of them at the same time so they’d sound close to similar. A colleague contacted the speaker manufacturer and suggested a replacement driver, so sourced that. Then purchased replacement components for the board and re-soldered the new ones on – sourced from https://willys-hifi.com which was a great site for this. Nice and easy fix, if a little expensive for the customers.
Black Magic Smoke Machine,mains_to_usb,20,TODO,Mains to USB,Generic,Bang,Scrap,£15.00,N/A,TODO,No,Sparks Repair Cafe,./power_supply_module/power_supply_module_2.jpg ./power_supply_module/power_supply_module_3.jpg ./power_supply_module/power_supply_module_1.jpg,Only including this because it was kind of funny. Somebody brought in this power adapter as it no longer worked, and when I handled it I could hear something rattling. Opened up the case and immediately saw the issue! Multiple components had exploded and were specks of dust in the case. Not worth repairing something this cheap and this destroyed, but fun to see what happens when the magic pixies don’t cooperate.
Roberts Radio Switch,roberts_radio,21,TODO,Radio,Roberts,Won’t switch FM/DAB Mode,Replace tactile switch,£110.00,0p,TODO,Yes,Sparks Repair Cafe,./roberts_radio_switch/roberts_radio_switch_1.jpg ./roberts_radio_switch/roberts_radio_switch_2.jpg,Somebody brought this radio in that would turn on, but the ability to switch between FM and DAB mode wouldn’t work. Taking it apart, it was just a small tactile switch that had maxed out the lifecycle. We had another sacrificial Roberts Radio that I could salvage the switch from, and worked very happily after that. Was a bit of a pain to get at the thing however!
Roberts Radio Voltage,roberts_radio,22,TODO,RD-60,Roberts,Screen won’t turn on,Removed the buck converter, replace with an LDO,£120.00,~15p,TODO,Yes,Sparks Repair Cafe,./roberts_radio_voltage/roberts_radio_voltage_1.jpg ./roberts_radio_voltage/roberts_radio_voltage_3.jpg ./roberts_radio_voltage/roberts_radio_voltage_12.jpg ./roberts_radio_voltage/roberts_radio_voltage_7.jpg ./roberts_radio_voltage/roberts_radio_voltage_8.jpg ./roberts_radio_voltage/roberts_radio_voltage_4.jpg ./roberts_radio_voltage/roberts_radio_voltage_2.jpg ./roberts_radio_voltage/roberts_radio_voltage_10.jpg ./roberts_radio_voltage/roberts_radio_voltage_5.jpg ./roberts_radio_voltage/roberts_radio_voltage_6.jpg ./roberts_radio_voltage/roberts_radio_voltage_11.jpg ./roberts_radio_voltage/roberts_radio_voltage_9.jpg,This was a marathon! I don’t usually spend so long on repairs, but a customer came in with a radio that was very sentimental to them, as a family member had bought it for them and they loved it dearly. I spent a long time looking at what was wrong with it. For a lot of the Roberts Radio line they provide schematics, service manual and block diagram! I was very impressed with the amount of information they give. Unfortunately, this model didn’t give you any of that… So I had to analyse the circuit on the board and figure out what things should be doing, and then figure out whether what they are currently doing are as designed. I came to the conclusion eventually that one of the supply rails for the microcontroller and radio receiver, was only receiving 3.21V, which when I first spotted that assumed it would be ‘enough’ for the necessary components to use. The add-on board that manages the radio and audio processing was a black box, no documentation or datasheets anywhere to be found. I deduced that it needed a 1.2V rail, as well as a 3.3V rail. I isolated the device that was generating the 3.3V by removing a diode in the buck converter, and then added a 3.3V supply from my bench top directly into that pad to see if that was the issue, and lo and behold, it works!! Then I just had to figure out how best to do this inside the device so that I could reassemble it. As ugly as it ended up being, I replaced the buck converter with an LDO providing 3.3V, as I could find the corresponding SMD pads to match when I soldered the LDO in a specific pattern. They use buck converters for this as it’s more efficient and as you run these devices from batteries, you want them as efficient as possible, but I figured it wasn’t a huge loss by contributing to a net negative in effficiency for the device… Reassembled the radio and got a very happy customer.
Sony Walkman ,walkman,23,TODO,Walkman,Sony,Intermittent audio connection,Get a replacement 3.5mm ,???,N/A,TODO,Yes,Sparks Repair Cafe,./sony_walkman/sony_walkman_1.jpg ./sony_walkman/sony_walkman_2.jpg,The audio jack would only work if you pressed the audio jack in at a certain angle, so this was an obvious fix. Re-solder the connector and make sure it is making a good connection and not likely to pry off again.
Til’ the wheels come off,trolley,24,TODO,Trolley,Generic,Wheel kept slipping off a trolley,Widen diameter of axle,???,2p,TODO,Yes,Sparks Repair Cafe,./trolley_wheel/trolley_wheel_1.jpg ./trolley_wheel/trolley_wheel_2.jpg,The wheel of a pull trolley kept falling off. Disassembling the mount, the plastic that holds the wheel on had lost the bend that it needs to hold the wheel on. I wrapped a load of teflon plumber’s tape around the axle to thicken it, and then forced the wheel over the bump so that it won’t come off again. Happy quick fix
Audio Amplifier,amplifier,25,TODO,Amplifier,Generic,USB connector not connecting,Re-solder connector,???,0p,TODO,Yes,Sparks Repair Cafe,./usb_amplifier/usb_amplifier_1.jpg,Bluetooth amplifier wouldn’t accept a charge from the USB cable, when looking closer the micro-usb connector had been bent off, and pulled a bunch of the traces with it off the PCB! Managed to re-heat the connector and push it down to make a connection again, and then plopped some epoxy over the back of the connector to take some of the strain out.
Vacuum ,,26,TODO,,,Belt had burnt through,Replace belt and clean head,???,0p,TODO,Yes,Sparks Repair Cafe,./vacuum1/vacuum1_3.jpg ./vacuum1/vacuum1_1.jpg ./vacuum1/vacuum1_2.jpg ./vacuum1/vacuum1_4.jpg,The vacuum would create suction, but the head of the vacuum wouldn’t spin to pull up hair and dust. Having a look inside, the mechanism had gotten gunged up and was impossible to spin, and the belt to attach from the motor to the head had melted through. Thankfully the customers brought in a spare belt that came with the vacuum cleaner! Nice and easy fix to clean out the mechanism so that it could spin freely, and attach the new belt.
