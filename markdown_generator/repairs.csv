It would give some error code on the screen that didn’t describe much and Google searching came up with no information! I could hear a relay engaging before it switched off, so there must be some software deciding to turn itself off, so I figured that the code was successfully executing but some status during the bootup sequence was bad and engaged some safety process. I spent the end of many sessions trying to get into this thing, and then diagnosing it. Both of the control boards were fine, no visible issues that screamed error. Started unplugging cables that went to the control board to see which one triggered the fail state, and eventually found a 2-cable connector that would cause it to fail the boot process. When I unplugged it, it was able to get past that auto shut off, but then returned an error later in the boot process saying that something was disconnected. Followed that cable and it lead to a pressure sensor of sorts that wasn’t well connected, so I think it just wasn’t making electrical contact! Re-connected it and reassembled the machine, and then got to enjoy a cup of coffee from the machine. Very satisfying cup of coffee!"
Shredded gears with your e-bike sir?,e_bike,7,07-2023,E-bike,Unbranded,Shredded planetary gears,Replace gearbox and bearings ,£800,£25.00,TODO,Yes,Sparks Repair Cafe,/images/repair_cafe/e-bike/e-bike_1.jpg /images/repair_cafe/e-bike/e-bike_14.jpg /images/repair_cafe/e-bike/e-bike_8.jpg /images/repair_cafe/e-bike/e-bike_15.jpg /images/repair_cafe/e-bike/e-bike_9.jpg /images/repair_cafe/e-bike/e-bike_5.jpg /images/repair_cafe/e-bike/e-bike_6.jpg /images/repair_cafe/e-bike/e-bike_16.jpg /images/repair_cafe/e-bike/e-bike_4.jpg /images/repair_cafe/e-bike/e-bike_17.jpg /images/repair_cafe/e-bike/e-bike_12.jpg /images/repair_cafe/e-bike/e-bike_3.jpg /images/repair_cafe/e-bike/e-bike_10.jpg /images/repair_cafe/e-bike/e-bike_7.jpg /images/repair_cafe/e-bike/e-bike_2.jpg /images/repair_cafe/e-bike/e-bike_11.jpg /images/repair_cafe/e-bike/e-bike_13.jpg,"We had this e-bike that was donated to the repair cafe, that no longer worked and the person involved didn’t want it back as they had an upgrade and had been told it was unfixable. Bit of diagnosing later, as I could get the motor to spin with the throttle, but the wheel itself would stop and start and stutter, which didn’t make much sense. I knew that the battery was fine as I could test the voltage on that, and as it’s a brushless motor and controller, it didn’t make much sense why the wheel would stop/start/stop, so seemed more of a mechanical issue. So I removed the whole motor connectors and opened the housing for the in-wheel motor. Inside the housing was a disgusting mix of black grease, along with the remains of the nylon planetary gears that had been absolutely shredded to the extent that they were basically smooth around 2/3 of the gear face! This made sense why the wheel would spin for a little bit and then stop! When I was re-assembling the motor housing I found out why the gears had shredded themselves to bits however! The bearings for the motor were totally seized and would not budge in the slightest!! So the motor and gearbox would have been straining against seized bearings which would allow a bit of movement and then stop, which is most likely why the gears got shredded. Bought a bunch of new bearings and pressed those in happily. Then I had to source a replacement planetary gear set and re-grease it and assemble which all was possible and found the exact match of nylon pair and flooded the gearbox with a bunch of high temp grease and it works like a dream. I still get messages from the person who eventually got it who is very happy with it and has no issues"

Taking it apart, when looking at the PCB there was a very obvious track that had gotten so hot it de-laminated itself and burnt the copper track such that it was an open circuit! When taking it further apart, what had happened was the control and power cables that go up to the control module, had been crushed in a pinch point in the scooter stem, causing a GPIO line to the microcontroller to get a whopping 24V! This was the GPIO line that measures the throttle, so once I’d sorted and fixed the cable, even though it would turn on, and the micro would do something (send signals to the gate drivers), the GPIO pin on the micro was toast, and the entire thing would have to be replaced. As the code to flash the micro is unavailable, it is essentially un-fixable. I looked online for suitable brushless motor controllers at 24V, but couldn’t find one that would fit the requirements for the scooter. Unfortunately, the whole electric portion of this scooter is now broken. It still functions as a scooter though!"

Electrical test between them showed a bad connection in the 3.5mm jack end, and they’d already brought in a 3.5mm jack to replace it with. The quality of the existing cables wasn’t great so I thought it better and easier to swap it out for a moulded 3.5mm jack. Went through the junk collection we have and found a perfectly suitable one to replace it with, that saved the wire getting junked for scrap."

I couldn’t resist opening it up and having a look at what the issue was. Turns out the IMU chip itself had an issue during soldering, causing 3.3V to be shorted to ground, as you can see in the photos. This was quite surprising, as if 3.3V was shorted, it wouldn’t have been possible to flash the devices in the factory with the microcontroller code? The corresponding microcontroller is powered by 3.3V, so it needed that rail to be correct. The manufacturers obviously didn’t have a check to see if the micros were successfully flashed! We got a full refund once we showed these images"

Opened it up and there was a bunch of backlight LEDs that had shorted and exploded, which meant that the LED power rail had been ruined. Removed the offending LEDs and followed the rail back to the source, but still wouldn’t generate the voltage required. Followed the connection from the LED to a chip that controls the screen matrix, and there’s some issue there, but there is no documentation available for that chip, so it’s basically a dead end at that point. The parts did not go to waste however! The battery has gone towards a project I’m working on that needed a nice flat battery!"

Bought a replacement NTC and put that in a suitable position and it all works fine! The standard NTC for this battery was a 10kR, but it’s worth checking with the original as if you choose the wrong ranged resistor, the onboard micro might consider it as a fault!"

I thought it would be an issue from the push buttons not making a good connection, but they all worked properly. Unfortuantely probably something with the electronic portal to hell that heats the food. Into the scrap it went, but we kept the control board to salvage components as and when we need them."

Had a cursory look at the PA deck, to make sure nothing was wrong there and didn’t see anything immediately broken. Open the speaker cabs and look at the pre-filters and the 20W resistor as part of the RLC filter had gotten so hot the legs had exploded out of both speakers! The thermal fuse on both boards inside the speakers had exploded and released their magic smoke. One of the cones sounded pretty damaged, my rubric for that being if you push in on one of the cones and hear a ‘crinkly’ sound, like a crisp packet being rustled, the driver is damaged. One speaker cone sounded exactly like that, and the other one sounded similar bit not as bad. I asked the people who brought them in, and they were happy to replace both of them at the same time so they’d sound close to similar. A colleague contacted the speaker manufacturer and suggested a replacement driver, so sourced that. Then purchased replacement components for the board and re-soldered the new ones on – sourced from https://willys-hifi.com which was a great site for this. Nice and easy fix, if a little expensive for the customers."

I don’t usually spend so long on repairs, but a customer came in with a radio that was very sentimental to them, as a family member had bought it for them and they loved it dearly. I spent a long time looking at what was wrong with it. For a lot of the Roberts Radio line they provide schematics, service manual and block diagram! I was very impressed with the amount of information they give. Unfortunately, this model didn’t give you any of that… So I had to analyse the circuit on the board and figure out what things should be doing, and then figure out whether what they are currently doing are as designed. I came to the conclusion eventually that one of the supply rails for the microcontroller and radio receiver, was only receiving 3.21V, which when I first spotted that assumed it would be ‘enough’ for the necessary components to use. The add-on board that manages the radio and audio processing was a black box, no documentation or datasheets anywhere to be found. I deduced that it needed a 1.2V rail, as well as a 3.3V rail. I isolated the device that was generating the 3.3V by removing a diode in the buck converter, and then added a 3.3V supply from my bench top directly into that pad to see if that was the issue, and lo and behold, it works!! Then I just had to figure out how best to do this inside the device so that I could reassemble it. As ugly as it ended up being, I replaced the buck converter with an LDO providing 3.3V, as I could find the corresponding SMD pads to match when I soldered the LDO in a specific pattern. They use buck converters for this as it’s more efficient and as you run these devices from batteries, you want them as efficient as possible, but I figured it wasn’t a huge loss by contributing to a net negative in effficiency for the device… Reassembled the radio and got a very happy customer."

Hair Straighteners ,hair_straighteners,34,07-2024,Hair Straighteners ,Unknown,Intermittently turning off,Re-solder wire connection,£160,0p,8 yrs,Yes,Sparks Repair Cafe,/images/repair_cafe/hair_straighteners/hair_straighteners_1.jpg /images/repair_cafe/hair_straighteners/hair_straighteners_2.jpg,"Customer brought this in, and she had the issue that when you would turn it on and use it, they would suddenly turn off! Opened them up and found that one of the main power connections to the heating element had snapped due to movement. Re-solder it and crimp it down and it works happily. One interesting note about these straighteners is that they do not have a sensor feedback to detect temperature that I could spot, so they must work on calibrated heat elements and some form of current control with a known power loss. Quite clever design inside too."
Koala Light ,koala_light,35,07-2024,Night light,Generic,Won't turn on,"""Dead battery, re-wire to be plug powered only""",£15,0p,Unknown,Yes,Home,/images/repair_cafe/koala_light/koala_light_1.jpg /images/repair_cafe/koala_light/koala_light_2.jpg,"This was an item that had been chucked into recycling that looked far too cute to bin. The issue was the cheap lithium battery had died, and the lights required it to function at all. I removed the battery and bypassed the charging circuit so that the LEDs run purely on a USB power supply. Family member is now the happy owner of this cute night light."
Kindle ,kindle,36,07-2024,Kindle e-reader,Amazon Kindle,Stuck on screen,Send to Amazon for voucher off new kindle. Dead battery,£80,0p,5 yrs,No,Sparks Repair Cafe,/images/repair_cafe/kindle/kindle_1.jpg,"Customer brought in this Kindle that was stuck on the last page she read, and wouldn't charge at all. Opened it and measured the battery voltage which should have been 4.2V, when charging it would tick up but the second you removed the charging port the voltage would instantly drop back down. It is possible to buy replacement batteries for Kindles, but Amazon also runs a scheme where you can trade in kindles for vouchers and money off a new kindle so that's what the customer did, as it was an old model anyway."
Coffee Switch ,coffee_grinder_switch,37,06-2024,Coffee Grinder,Generic,Button won't work,Glue flexible plastic,£45,0p,3ys,Yes,Sparks Repair Cafe,/images/repair_cafe/coffee_grinder_switch/coffee_grinder_switch_1.jpg /images/repair_cafe/coffee_grinder_switch/coffee_grinder_switch_2.jpg /images/repair_cafe/coffee_grinder_switch/coffee_grinder_switch_3.jpg,"We have had three of these into the cafe, all with the exact same problem. They use a piece of plastic to act as the spring for the on button, which over the liftime snaps and breaks. Thus the button becomes stuck and does not activate. The solution we have found works well is to use some hard plastic that flexes a bit and glue or drill it into a support structure."
More Roberts Radios! ,roberts_radio_buck,38,06-2024,Radio,Roberts,"""Won't boot; dead buck controller""",Replace buck with LDO with enable,£80,£3.50,5yrs	,Yes,Sparks Repair Cafe,/images/repair_cafe/roberts_radio_buck/roberts_radio_buck_1.jpg /images/repair_cafe/roberts_radio_buck/roberts_radio_buck_2.jpg /images/repair_cafe/roberts_radio_buck/roberts_radio_buck_3.jpg,"At this point I have fixed three Roberts radios so I'm somewhat the expert. Customer brought this in and wouldn't boot or show anything on the screen. Found the schematics and the service manual that gives you a flow chart to diagnose and look for voltages. One of the main supply voltages after the power in wasn't being produced! There should be a 5.3V rail being generated, but it wasn't present at all. That rail is generated by a buck controller that was sending a constant voltage to a MOSFET, so the controller was obviously dead. I tried looking for replacement parts for that controller in the same package, but to no avail. They use bucks for efficiency as this radio is able to run from batteries, but I'm not fussed about efficiencies for repairs like this. I found a suitable 5.3V LDO that I had kicking around that also has an enable pin. Wired up my little abomination with enamalled wire and hey presto! Working radio!! I think there's still an issue with something on the LCD screen as the contrast isn't that high. It's getting the necessary power, but there are supposed to be some configuration resistors but I couldn't find a datasheet for the LCD so that's as far as I was willing to go for that."
Dodgy Charger Port,laptop_charger,39,05-2024,Laptop Charging Port,Lenovo,Won't charge unless held in position,Replace charging port,£450,£12,4yrs,Yes,Sparks Repair Cafe,/images/repair_cafe/laptop_charger/laptop_charger_1.jpg /images/repair_cafe/laptop_charger/laptop_charger_2.jpg,"Customer brought this in who didn't have the funds to take it to a repair shop so we replaced the charging port for them if they paid for the parts. The issue was the connector in there relies on a piece of sprung metal to make a connection with the terminals. This over time had snapped and now only made a contact if you forced the charger into the socket, so less than ideal. Purchased a port component and soldered it at home where I had my high powered soldering iron as it required quite a bit of heat to flood the many layers in the motherboard! Often for a job like this if I don't care about the component I'm removing, I'll destroy/disassemble it in place so that less heat is being removed from my iron, so the remaining parts are smaller and require less heat to remove and I'm thus less likely to damage the board from heat. Soldered the new one in place and happily charges now."
Hand(le) off my guitar! ,guitar_case,40,06-2024,Guitar Case,Generic,Handle came off,Braided steel wire with rivets,£60,20p,15 yrs,Yes,Sparks Repair Cafe,/images/repair_cafe/guitar_case/guitar_case_1.jpg,"Somebody brought in a guitar case that the handle came off, that they were having issues trying to reattach. We agreed that a good solution that would still allow the handle to 'swing' would be to thread braided steel wire and rivet the wire in place through the body. This involved peeling back the fabric lining to expose the mounting holes, then feeding the wire through and then riveting the pieces in place in the hole. Definitely not going anywhere, so a safe guitar!"""

Tried to press off the bearing to see if we could replace it, but was not budging. Method instead was to flood the bearing and twist it by hand to crush the dust and muck inside the bearing, and keep flooding it with oil so that the detritus leaked out of the bearing. With enough spinning and oil it ended up clean enough and worked happily. Extended the life a bit more of this sander!"
Torpedo timer (Yes that cool) ,torpedo_timer,44,05-2024,Torpedo Timer,Robert North and Sons,Wouldn't wind up,Forward to watch maker contact,£2450,0p,~75 years,No,Sparks Repair Cafe,/images/repair_cafe/torpedo_timer/torpedo_timer_1.jpg /images/repair_cafe/torpedo_timer/torpedo_timer_2.jpg /images/repair_cafe/torpedo_timer/torpedo_timer_3.jpg /images/repair_cafe/torpedo_timer/torpedo_timer_4.jpg /images/repair_cafe/torpedo_timer/torpedo_timer_5.jpg,"Well this was an incredible first. A torpedo clock timer from the second world war!! Somebody brought this is because they wanted help figuring out why it didn't work, and how to fix it. This was by far the coolest thing to come into the cafe! The issue in the end is that one of the gears for winding up the coil had been damaged and the teeth were stripped off the gearface. We have a volunteer that knows somebody who manufactures custom gears for precisely this kind of application so we passed on their number and wished them the best."

Usually with these things it's a thermal fuse that dies, so checked those, and no issue there. After pondering, and other volunteers pondering I left it for a while. Then another volunteer who took over found that there's a dedicated resettable thermal fuse that you have to press down to reset! This was written nowhere in the manual though!!!!"

A DC powered magnifier and light. Opening it up revealed an absolutely catastrophic death of some poor transistor that had turned to DUST!. I removed the board as it had cracked in half as well. Replaced the circuit with something on stripboard to have an adjustable current source to drive the LEDs. It is now used in our cafe to repair other things!

It would open and receive a CD, but then would get stuck on track 1 and never play. Turns out running the mechanism with the shell off revealed that the tilt mechanism to engage the motor wasn't being activated properly. The belt that had the job to activate the mechanism to tilt was just spinning in place and never being activated. Replaced the belt with a suitable one and added some drops of oil on the plastic parts that wipe together and it loads and plays CDs correctly!"""
