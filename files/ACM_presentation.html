Patrol: Constrained Interactions Can Promote Accurate Consensus. I'll 
give a brief overview of the paper and our findings, as well as the

<aside class="notes"><p>So first, a little bit of motivation for the 
investigation. Let us imagine the scenario where we have an office 
environment, and there is an unexpected anomaly somewhere. This could be
 an intruder, or it could be a radio frequency device listening in and 
broadcasting information out. The job of the agents is to find the 
anomaly in this large area and reach a consensus of where it is. This 
could be solved by having agents patrol the area looking for the 
anomaly.</p>

<aside class="notes"><p>Often in the literature the patrol problem is 
decomposed into a task allocation problem. We have an area, we split it 
up into regions and create a node graph out of those regions. Then it's a
 Travelling Salesman problem, but for a weakly connected graph that does
 not lend itself well to Hamiltonian decomposition.
One thing to note about these approaches, is that they assume the 
patrolling problem is 'solved' by minimizing the time since a node was 
last visited.</p>

<p><img src="ACM_presentation_files/cumberland.png" alt=""></p>
<aside class="notes"><p>So given a map of where we have to patrol, it 
needs to be abstracted into a graph for the agents to navigate. This is 
often performed by approximate Voronoi partitioning and you end up with 
something like this</p>

<p><img src="ACM_presentation_files/cumberland-graph.png" alt=""></p>
<aside class="notes"><p>So now you have a graph with vertices and edges 
to patrol, and it becomes a task allocation problem! You just ensure 
that each node is frequently visited and you solve it. Unsurprisingly 
this isn't a simple problem and there are many approaches:</p>

<p><img src="ACM_presentation_files/algorithms_examined.png" alt=""></p>
<aside class="notes"><p>In this paper, we examine ten of the leading 
algorithms presented in a simulation package that all attempt to solve 
the problem in slightly different ways. The formulation of the problem 
in this way aims to solve patrolling, by reducing the amount of time 
since an agent last visited a node. I'm not going to go through all of 
them but I will highlight some of the leading algorithms for minimizing 
idleness on a graph, that's DTAG, SEBS and CBLS.</p>

<aside class="notes"><p>So now we have the algorithms by which the 
agents are going to patrol, we need to establish a belief system that 
they can measure and communicate information about the world. For this 
work we used a ternary belief system, where the state of a node on the 
graph is either true, false or uncertain. Each agent begins their patrol
 being uncertain about every node, and as they visit nodes they gain new
 information. Either true for an anomaly being detected, or false for no
 anomaly being detected. Upon visiting a node, an agent takes a simple 
'measurement' which consists of polling the node given a specified 
chance of making an incorrect reading. Over time, the system reaches a 
convergence on what a majority of the agents believe about the world.</p>

<aside class="notes"><p>For agents to take advantage of the collective 
perception, they need to be able to communicate. Each agent has a 
maximum communication range, and a communication timeout period, whereby
 once an agent has communicated with another agent, they cannot talk to 
one another after some set period. Here the benefit of the ternary 
belief state comes into play, where on the right we have the truth table
 for the beliefs. Two conflicting opinions of false and true, result in 
both agents coming out of that communication event being uncertain about
 that node. This is performed for each node in the world between the two
 agents communicating.</p>

The communication range, set as a tenth of the map distance. The timeout
 period set as the average amount of time to travel from node to another
 node. Number of agents, as this was the largest number of agents 
possible to run on the map before they suffered from performance 
reduction due to collisions. and then each experiment ran for an hour, 
with 0, 5, 10 and 20% chance of noise in measuring a node. Each 
combination of algorithm and noise value was performed 20 times in order
 to take an average.</p>

come to the results that we found after running each of the algorithms

 were by looking at the algebraic connectivity of their social network, 
if I have time I'll play a video of a series of the algorithms to get a 
sense of their behaviour, I'll show the F-score performance (which is a 
measure of how accurate the system was compared to the true world) for 
each algorithm, as well as the average idleness for the algorithms to 
give a sense of the performance at each rubric. and then I'll talk about
 their performance of True positives and False positives.</p>

<aside class="notes"><p>So in order to judge how connected the networks 
are, the communication events between each agents are logged. Each node 
on this graph is a unique agent, and the strength of the connection 
between the nodes is the number of communications. So we can see in this
 instance, agents 0,1 and 2 talk to one another a lot, but less so to 
other agents.</p>

each algorithm, as well as how dense the communication was, whether each
 agent gained information from every other agent on the map or just its

<ul>
<li>Moderate connectivity algorithms perform best</li>
<li>High connectivity algorithms perform worse</li>
<li>Low connectivity algorithms perform worst</li>
<li>Exception is CGG algorithm<ul>
<li>Guaranteed to <em>personally</em> check nodes<aside class="notes"><p>So
 to summarise the findings, we find are that algorithms with the lowest 
connectivity, so that's DTAG and DTAP, perform the worst in regard to 
F-score, the algorithms with the highest connectivity perform slightly 
better, but the best performing algorithms at overall F-score 
performance are ones with moderate connectivity. This doesn't hold for a
 particular algorithm of CGG, which is one of the worst performing for 
idleness minimization, and we believe this to be due to the intrinsic 
behaviour of CGG. CGG stands for Cyclic Generic Graphs, which is at its 
core generating a hamiltonian cycle that the agents patrol around. 
Because each agent will visit every single node on the graph, they do 
not <em>just</em> consider the information from their neighbours to 
judge a node's state. This we believe leads to a minimization of noise 
propagation throughout the system</p>

<ul>
<li>F<sub>1</sub>-score is not perfect</li>
<li>Belief system is not perfect</li>
<li>Do results hold for number of agents?</li>
<li>Judging algorithms at a new task</li>
<li>Communication range and timeout period<aside class="notes"><p>So for
 these results we limited the scope of what we were investigating, 
knowing that there were limitations in our approach that we didn't have 
the bandwidth to investigate. Some of these are the analytical methods 
that we used, namely the use of F1-score, while it gives an insight into
 the overall performance of a binary classification (anomaly or no 
anomaly), perhaps in an instance we care more about the ratio of false 
NEGATIVES, as that would be a severe scenario, but aren't too concerned 
about false positives. The number of agents was chosen based on the best
 performance for idleness minimization with a given map size, while 
minimizing the number of collisions between agents. 
 There is also something to be said for judging an algorithms 
performance for something it wasn't designed for. This is a fair 
critique, and we saw it more as a challenge to the formulation of the 
patrolling problem, as opposed to a shortcoming of the algorithms 
themselves. We are also currently working on the communication range and
 timeout period, which I will get onto in the next slide.</p>

<ul>
<li>Investigating variation of communication range and timeout period</li>
<li>Bayesian belief system &amp; confidence intervals</li>
<li>Real experiments with RF anomaly<aside class="notes"><p>So like I 
mentioned, we are currently looking at the influence of communication 
range and the timeout period on the performance of the algorithms. We 
chose values for our paper with a valid justification and to limit the 
scope, but there is work to be done into the optimal values for each 
algorithm. We are also changing the belief system and communication 
model, to re-introduce some granularity. We used a simple ternary belief
 system as we were building from previous work, and we knew that it 
enabled faster convergence, but we don't assume it is a superior system.
 With this in mind we are looking to implement a Bayesian belief model 
in order to arrive at confidence intervals for measurements. We also 
have a collaboration starting where we will perform real-world 
experiments trying to detect and localise a radio device hidden 
somewhere in an environment, which should be interesting.</p>
