Pair of Marshall wireless headphones that would work if you plugged an audio source into the 3.5mm audio jack, but wouldn’t boot and accept a bluetooth connection. Opened them up, and the battery was entirely dead! Sourced a replacement that would fit inside the headphones, but they didn’t come with an NTC resistor like the original battery. Bought a replacement NTC and put that in a suitable position and it all works fine! The standard NTC for this battery was a 10kR, but it’s worth checking with the original as if you choose the wrong ranged resistor, the onboard micro might consider it as a fault!
