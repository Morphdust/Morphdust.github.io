Customer brought this in, and she had the issue that when you would turn it on and use it, they would suddenly turn off! Opened them up and found that one of the main power connections to the heating element had snapped due to movement. Re-solder it and crimp it down and it works happily. One interesting note about these straighteners is that they do not have a sensor feedback to detect temperature that I could spot, so they must work on calibrated heat elements and some form of current control with a known power loss. Quite clever design inside too.
