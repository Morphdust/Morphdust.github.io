Bluetooth amplifier wouldnâ€™t accept a charge from the USB cable, when looking closer the micro-usb connector had been bent off, and pulled a bunch of the traces with it off the PCB! Managed to re-heat the connector and push it down to make a connection again, and then plopped some epoxy over the back of the connector to take some of the strain out.
