Somebody brought this radio in that would turn on, but the ability to switch between FM and DAB mode wouldn’t work. Taking it apart, it was just a small tactile switch that had maxed out the lifecycle. We had another sacrificial Roberts Radio that I could salvage the switch from, and worked very happily after that. Was a bit of a pain to get at the thing however!
