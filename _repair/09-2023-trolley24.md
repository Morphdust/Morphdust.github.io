The wheel of a pull trolley kept falling off. Disassembling the mount, the plastic that holds the wheel on had lost the bend that it needs to hold the wheel on. I wrapped a load of teflon plumber’s tape around the axle to thicken it, and then forced the wheel over the bump so that it won’t come off again. Happy quick fix
