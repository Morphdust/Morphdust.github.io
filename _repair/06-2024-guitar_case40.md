Somebody brought in a guitar case that the handle came off, that they were having issues trying to reattach. We agreed that a good solution that would still allow the handle to &apos;swing&apos; would be to thread braided steel wire and rivet the wire in place through the body. This involved peeling back the fabric lining to expose the mounting holes, then feeding the wire through and then riveting the pieces in place in the hole. Definitely not going anywhere, so a safe guitar!&quot;
