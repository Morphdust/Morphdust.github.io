&quot;Coffee grinder came in that just suddenly stopped working one day. Opening it up didn&apos;t make much sense as all the components looked fine. Trying to follow the connections to the motor revealed that one of the terminals of the motor wasn&apos;t connected. Upon closer inspection the wire connection had somehow snapped!&quot;
