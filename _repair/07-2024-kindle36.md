Customer brought in this Kindle that was stuck on the last page she read, and wouldn&apos;t charge at all. Opened it and measured the battery voltage which should have been 4.2V, when charging it would tick up but the second you removed the charging port the voltage would instantly drop back down. It is possible to buy replacement batteries for Kindles, but Amazon also runs a scheme where you can trade in kindles for vouchers and money off a new kindle so that&apos;s what the customer did, as it was an old model anyway.
