Water got spilled on a friend’s laptop, and would turn on but the screen didn’t show anything. Taking it apart showed the connection from the mobo to the screen had a short and melted and damaged the screen connector. The whole connector would have to be replaced, which I’m going to do once I source the right component and reset the laptop.
