We have had three of these into the cafe, all with the exact same problem. They use a piece of plastic to act as the spring for the on button, which over the liftime snaps and breaks. Thus the button becomes stuck and does not activate. The solution we have found works well is to use some hard plastic that flexes a bit and glue or drill it into a support structure.
