Coffee machine that came in from one of the stalls in sparks that would have an error during the boot up sequence. It would give some error code on the screen that didn’t describe much and Google searching came up with no information! I could hear a relay engaging before it switched off, so there must be some software deciding to turn itself off, so I figured that the code was successfully executing but some status during the bootup sequence was bad and engaged some safety process. I spent the end of many sessions trying to get into this thing, and then diagnosing it. Both of the control boards were fine, no visible issues that screamed error. Started unplugging cables that went to the control board to see which one triggered the fail state, and eventually found a 2-cable connector that would cause it to fail the boot process. When I unplugged it, it was able to get past that auto shut off, but then returned an error later in the boot process saying that something was disconnected. Followed that cable and it lead to a pressure sensor of sorts that wasn’t well connected, so I think it just wasn’t making electrical contact! Re-connected it and reassembled the machine, and then got to enjoy a cup of coffee from the machine. Very satisfying cup of coffee!
