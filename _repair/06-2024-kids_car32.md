Customer came in with a kids electric car that wouldn&apos;t drive due to a dead battery. They brought in a battery to replace which I inserted, but it still woudln&apos;t drive! Worked backwards from the motor, which worked, and found that the accelerator pedal is a momentary KCD4 switch that wasn&apos;t making the correct connection. After a bunch of attempts to fix the existing switch, I opted for buying a brand new one. Soldered in it and reassembled and had one happy small child!
