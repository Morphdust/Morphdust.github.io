Well this was an incredible first. A torpedo clock timer from the second world war!! Somebody brought this is because they wanted help figuring out why it didn&apos;t work, and how to fix it. This was by far the coolest thing to come into the cafe! The issue in the end is that one of the gears for winding up the coil had been damaged and the teeth were stripped off the gearface. We have a volunteer that knows somebody who manufactures custom gears for precisely this kind of application so we passed on their number and wished them the best.
