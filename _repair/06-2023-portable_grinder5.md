Problem:    Motor wouldn’t move grinder 
Solution:   Insert missing circlip 
Brand:  UFIT 
Cost new:   £25.00 
Cost of fix:    1p 
Age:    TODO 
Success?:   Yes 
```
Grinder was donated in the junk box, that would hold a charge and you could hear the motor spin, but the actual grinder mechanism wouldn’t engage. Open the device up and one of the circlips that holds the attachment in place had snapped or come loose, and now the thing was fixed for the cost of a 1p circlip! One of our volunteers is using it to grind up egg shells to make egg shell porcelain with!
