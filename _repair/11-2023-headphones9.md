Headphones came in that had an intermittent connection and would crackle on one of the speakers. Electrical test between them showed a bad connection in the 3.5mm jack end, and they’d already brought in a 3.5mm jack to replace it with. The quality of the existing cables wasn’t great so I thought it better and easier to swap it out for a moulded 3.5mm jack. Went through the junk collection we have and found a perfectly suitable one to replace it with, that saved the wire getting junked for scrap.
