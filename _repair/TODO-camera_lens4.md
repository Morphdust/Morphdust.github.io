Camera came in that had issue automatically opening the lens covers when booting. Disassemble and very precisely add a tiny dab of oil on the mechanism that releases/retracts the covers. Cycle the camera a few times and now the mechanism opens happily. Pretty sure a collection of dust and nasty stuff gunked up the mechanism
