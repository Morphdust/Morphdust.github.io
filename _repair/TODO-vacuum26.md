The vacuum would create suction, but the head of the vacuum wouldnâ€™t spin to pull up hair and dust. Having a look inside, the mechanism had gotten gunged up and was impossible to spin, and the belt to attach from the motor to the head had melted through. Thankfully the customers brought in a spare belt that came with the vacuum cleaner! Nice and easy fix to clean out the mechanism so that it could spin freely, and attach the new belt.
