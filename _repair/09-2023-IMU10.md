This is an issue I had during PhD, where we’d purchased a few IMUs at once and one of them just wouldn’t boot and wouldn’t turn on. I couldn’t resist opening it up and having a look at what the issue was. Turns out the IMU chip itself had an issue during soldering, causing 3.3V to be shorted to ground, as you can see in the photos. This was quite surprising, as if 3.3V was shorted, it wouldn’t have been possible to flash the devices in the factory with the microcontroller code? The corresponding microcontroller is powered by 3.3V, so it needed that rail to be correct. The manufacturers obviously didn’t have a check to see if the micros were successfully flashed! We got a full refund once we showed these images
