Don’t usually look at microwaves, but thought it might be an easy fix of a dodgy connector, as the screen would turn on and you could change dials and settings, but didn’t actually ‘go’ and start powering the microwave. I thought it would be an issue from the push buttons not making a good connection, but they all worked properly. Unfortuantely probably something with the electronic portal to hell that heats the food. Into the scrap it went, but we kept the control board to salvage components as and when we need them.
