This was a turntable that was found in the recycling bin, which we thought must be able to be fixed. Powers on, but as it&apos;s a direct drive turntable, you need to ensure the marks on the disc are synchronised with the pulsed light. These are controlled by the trimming potentiometers, which no matter how much you spinned them they didn&apos;t seem to synchronise. Opened the unit and squirted a bunch of switch cleaner into the potentiometers and there we go! When we put a record on however, we realised the stylus had been terribly abused and is missing the sharp diamond point. A new stylus is on order for £20 and we are seeing what we can do about the counterweight. This will go on to be sold at the cafe to keep our funds going.
