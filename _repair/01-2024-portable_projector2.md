This projector came in that wouldn’t boot at all. It’s a portable mini projector,  but no buttons would do anything and wouldn’t work. Started to disassemble,  and checked the battery which was totally dead! You can’t get replacements for this battery because it’s got to be a specific size in order to fit inside the container. Unfortunate very expensive and sophisticated bit of kit all to end up as junk because you can’t get a replacement battery, and you can’t run it by having it plugged in!
