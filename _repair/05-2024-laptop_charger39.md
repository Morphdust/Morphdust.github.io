Customer brought this in who didn&apos;t have the funds to take it to a repair shop so we replaced the charging port for them if they paid for the parts. The issue was the connector in there relies on a piece of sprung metal to make a connection with the terminals. This over time had snapped and now only made a contact if you forced the charger into the socket, so less than ideal. Purchased a port component and soldered it at home where I had my high powered soldering iron as it required quite a bit of heat to flood the many layers in the motherboard! Often for a job like this if I don&apos;t care about the component I&apos;m removing, I&apos;ll destroy/disassemble it in place so that less heat is being removed from my iron, so the remaining parts are smaller and require less heat to remove and I&apos;m thus less likely to damage the board from heat. Soldered the new one in place and happily charges now.
