This was quite a fun one that I did, as it wasn&apos;t working and all and wouldn&apos;t turn on. Usually with these things it&apos;s a thermal fuse that dies, so checked those, and no issue there. After pondering, and other volunteers pondering I left it for a while. Then another volunteer who took over found that there&apos;s a dedicated resettable thermal fuse that you have to press down to reset! This was written nowhere in the manual though!!!!
