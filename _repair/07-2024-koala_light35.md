This was an item that had been chucked into recycling that looked far too cute to bin. The issue was the cheap lithium battery had died, and the lights required it to function at all. I removed the battery and bypassed the charging circuit so that the LEDs run purely on a USB power supply. Family member is now the happy owner of this cute night light.
