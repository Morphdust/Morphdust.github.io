Only including this because it was kind of funny. Somebody brought in this power adapter as it no longer worked, and when I handled it I could hear something rattling. Opened up the case and immediately saw the issue! Multiple components had exploded and were specks of dust in the case. Not worth repairing something this cheap and this destroyed, but fun to see what happens when the magic pixies don’t cooperate.
