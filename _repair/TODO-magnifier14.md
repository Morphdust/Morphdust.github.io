A magnification and combined lamp wouldn’t turn on the lights found in the recycling bin. Taking it apart there’s a simple potentiometer that controls the current to the LEDs via a BJT that had exploded and taken the PCB with it. Jury-rigged a simple circuit on perfboard that connects to the potentiometer that achieves the same thing. It is now my desk magnification for when I need something extra!
