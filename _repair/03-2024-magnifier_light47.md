This was something found in the recycling bin that I thought we could use. A DC powered magnifier and light. Opening it up revealed an absolutely catastrophic death of some poor transistor that had turned to DUST!. I removed the board as it had cracked in half as well. Replaced the circuit with something on stripboard to have an adjustable current source to drive the LEDs. It is now used in our cafe to repair other things!
