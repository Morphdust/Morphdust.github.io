Another volunteer said that they had come across a similar issue with xbox ones at another repair cafe, so this was nice and easy to diagnose! No HDMI signal on the output, but it boots up and displays the necessary lights. Identified the required HDMI timing IC and bought one (SN75DP159RSBR). Removed the old chip with my rework station and soldered the new chip on. Jobs a goodun!
