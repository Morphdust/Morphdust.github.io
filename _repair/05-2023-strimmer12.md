Electric strimmer wouldnâ€™t turn on and move, but all the connections from the plug to the cables seemed fine. Turns out inside the little choke before the motor connection, under the heatshrink, the spool of wire had been twisted too much and needed re-soldering. Nice and simple fix once the issue had been found!
