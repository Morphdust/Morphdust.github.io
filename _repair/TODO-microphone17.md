Device works fine in terms of recording audio and turning on, but there are a series of lines on the screen that donâ€™t disappear and never turn on. Open it up, and the ribbon cable connection from the screen to the mainboard was old and slightly corroded and making a bad connection. Used a bit of switch cleaner and a Q-Tip to clean up the connector and the issue disappeared!
