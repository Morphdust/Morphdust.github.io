&quot;Customer brought in a CD player that wouldn&apos;t play a CD and would just keep sticking. It would open and receive a CD, but then would get stuck on track 1 and never play. Turns out running the mechanism with the shell off revealed that the tilt mechanism to engage the motor wasn&apos;t being activated properly. The belt that had the job to activate the mechanism to tilt was just spinning in place and never being activated. Replaced the belt with a suitable one and added some drops of oil on the plastic parts that wipe together and it loads and plays CDs correctly!&quot;
