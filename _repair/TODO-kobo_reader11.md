E-reader had a bit of moisture ingress from something being spilled on it. Opened it up and there was a bunch of backlight LEDs that had shorted and exploded, which meant that the LED power rail had been ruined. Removed the offending LEDs and followed the rail back to the source, but still wouldn’t generate the voltage required. Followed the connection from the LED to a chip that controls the screen matrix, and there’s some issue there, but there is no documentation available for that chip, so it’s basically a dead end at that point. The parts did not go to waste however! The battery has gone towards a project I’m working on that needed a nice flat battery!
