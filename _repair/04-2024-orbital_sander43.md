The main bearing for the rotor had siezed up from too much dust entering it! Tried to press off the bearing to see if we could replace it, but was not budging. Method instead was to flood the bearing and twist it by hand to crush the dust and muck inside the bearing, and keep flooding it with oil so that the detritus leaked out of the bearing. With enough spinning and oil it ended up clean enough and worked happily. Extended the life a bit more of this sander!
