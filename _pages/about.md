This is my academic home page, welcome!

It's still a work in progress so please bear with me. In the meantime enjoy this picture of my cat.

I'm an Electronic Engineering student by background, currently working on an Engineering Mathematics PhD with a focus on collective dynamics of robotic systems.
I have a strong passion for electronics and embedded systems, and various projects that highlight these skills which I'll hopefully be throwing up onto this website soon enough.
